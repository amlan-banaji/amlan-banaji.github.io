From March to May 2024 I lectured the Elements of Topology mathematics course to 90 second-year undergraduate students at Loughborough University.  

In addition, from 2019 to 2022 I was a tutor for the following undergraduate tutorials at the University of St Andrews: 

- Analysis (10 groups total)
- Abstract Algebra (2 groups)
- Pure and Applied Mathematics (2 groups)
