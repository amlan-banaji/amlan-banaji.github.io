I am a Research Associate in Fractal Geometry in the [dynamical systems research group](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/maths/research/research-groups-and-centres/dynamical-systems/) of the mathematics department at Loughborough University, working with [Dr Simon Baker](https://simonbakermaths.wordpress.com/). I completed my PhD at the University of St Andrews in 2023, under the supervision of [Prof. Jonathan Fraser](https://jonathan-fraser.github.io/homepage/) and [Prof. Kenneth Falconer](https://kennethfalconer.github.io/index.html). 

My main research interests are in geometry and analysis related to fractal sets and measures. These 'fractals' exhibit complexity over a wide range of scales, and often arise in a natural dynamical way, such as via (conformal or non-conformal) iterated function systems. Currently, I am especially interested in the rate of decay of the Fourier transform of stationary measures for such systems. I have also done a lot of work exploring different ways one can define 'dimension,' to provide refined information about the global or local scaling properties of classes of sets or measures. I enjoy finding connections between these topics and other areas of mathematics such as number theory and probability theory. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2018. I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in mathematics at the University of St Andrews in 2019.
