I am a PhD student in mathematics at the University of St Andrews where I am part of the [analysis research group](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/). My supervisor is [Professor Jonathan Fraser](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/) and my second supervisor is [Professor Kenneth Falconer](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~kenneth/). My PhD began in 2019, and is fully funded by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust. 

My main research interests relate to the geometry and dimension theory of fractal sets and measures. I have worked extensively with fractals generated by conformal and non-conformal iterated function systems. Much of my research has been about interpolating between different notions of dimension. I am interested in finding connections between fractal geometry and other areas of mathematics. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2018. I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in mathematics at the University of St Andrews in 2019, where I won the Postgraduate Gray Prize for the best taught postgraduate student.
