I am a Research Associate in Fractal Geometry in the [dynamical systems research group](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/maths/research/research-groups-and-centres/dynamical-systems/) of the mathematics department at Loughborough University, working with [Dr Simon Baker](https://simonbakermaths.wordpress.com/). My PhD was at the University of St Andrews (2019-2023) under the supervision of [Prof. Jonathan Fraser](https://jonathan-fraser.github.io/homepage/) and [Prof. Kenneth Falconer](https://kennethfalconer.github.io/index.html). 

My main research interests relate to the geometry and dimension theory of fractal sets and measures. I have worked with fractals generated by conformal and non-conformal iterated function systems. I am currently interested in Fourier decay of fractal measures, and interpolating between different notions of dimension. I am interested in finding connections between fractal geometry and other areas of mathematics. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2018. I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in mathematics at the University of St Andrews in 2019.
