I am a postdoctoral researcher in mathematics at the University of Jyväskylä in Finland, working with [Tuomas Orponen](https://sites.google.com/view/tuomaths/). In September 2025, I will begin a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellowship titled "Fourier decay for nonlinear fractal measures," also at Jyväskylä. I was previously a postdoc at Loughborough University in the UK, working with [Simon Baker](https://simonbakermaths.wordpress.com/). I completed my PhD at the University of St Andrews in 2023, under the supervision of [Jonathan Fraser](https://jonathan-fraser.github.io/homepage/) and [Kenneth Falconer](https://kennethfalconer.github.io/index.html). I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2018. 

My main research interests are in geometry and analysis related to fractal sets and measures. Fractals are intricate and often beautiful mathematical objects which exhibit complexity over a wide range of scales, and often arise in a natural dynamical way, such as via (conformal or non-conformal) iterated function systems. Currently, I am especially interested in the rate of decay of the Fourier transform of stationary measures for such systems. Another strand of my research has been to explore different ways one can define 'dimension,' to provide refined information about the global or local scaling properties of classes of sets or measures. I enjoy finding connections between these topics and other areas of mathematics such as number theory and probability theory.
