As of March 2023, I am a Research Associate in Fractal Geometry in the [dynamical systems research group](https://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/maths/research/research-groups-and-centres/dynamical-systems/) of the mathematics department at Loughborough University, working with [Dr Simon Baker](https://simonbakermaths.wordpress.com/). My PhD was at the University of St Andrews under the supervision of [Professor Jonathan Fraser](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/) and [Regius Professor Kenneth Falconer](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~kenneth/). 

My main research interests relate to the geometry and dimension theory of fractal sets and measures. I have worked with fractals generated by conformal and non-conformal iterated function systems. Much of my research has been about interpolating between different notions of dimension. I am interested in finding connections between fractal geometry and other areas of mathematics. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2018. I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in mathematics at the University of St Andrews in 2019.
