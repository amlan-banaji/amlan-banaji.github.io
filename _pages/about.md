I am a PhD student in mathematics at the University of St Andrews where I am part of the [analysis research group](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/). My supervisor is [Professor Jonathan Fraser](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/) and my second supervisor is [Professor Kenneth Falconer](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~kenneth/). I started my PhD in 2019. 

My research focuses on fractal geometry, in particular interpolating between different notions of dimension, and is fully funded by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust. 

I completed my undergraduate degree in mathematics at the University of Cambridge in 2018. I completed a Masterâ€™s degree in mathematics at the University of St Andrews in 2019, where I won the Postgraduate Gray Prize (Science and Medicine) for the best taught postgraduate student for the 2018-2019 session based on the Grade Point Average.
