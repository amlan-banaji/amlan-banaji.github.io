I'm a EPSRC funded PhD student in mathematics at the University of St Andrews where I am part of the [analysis research group](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/pg/pure/Analysis/).

My research focuses on fractal geometry, but I'm also interested in dynamical systems and number theory (particularly Diophantine approximation).

I'm supervised by [Professor Kenneth Falconer](http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~kenneth/) and [Dr Jonathan Fraser](http://www.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jmf32/).

My Erdös number is 2 (Lee → Vaughan → Erdös).
